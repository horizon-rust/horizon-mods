# SMP (Horizon native server mod)

The official Horizon server's survival layer ([design](https://github.com/horizon-rust/horizon/blob/main/docs/smp.md)).
It is **not** part of Horizon's own server: only a server that builds this mod into its engine has it. It isn't listed
in the registry.

Players install nothing: it speaks only what a stock Horizon client already shows (commands with completions, chat
lines, vanilla chest menus the server fills with ordinary items (the trade menu); later sounds, titles, the action
bar, boss bars and the sidebar).

This version: the economy, the auction house, the server market and its `/shop` menu, player trades, the coinflip, the lottery, places (spawn, homes, warps,
teleport requests, the rules), land claims, and the scoreboard (a sidebar with your balance and playtime, the Tab list's
header and footer).

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `/balance [player]`, `/bal` | your balance, or another player's |
| `/pay <player> <amount>` | gives money to a player who has an account (anyone who has played since the mod was on) |
| `/baltop [page]` | the richest players, 10 a page |
| `/eco give <player> <amount> <reason>`, `/money give ...` | operators of level 3: makes money for a player (an event prize, a bug refund); everyone reads it with the reason, and the audit log keeps it |
| `/eco take <player> <amount> [reason]`, `/money take ...` | operators of level 3: takes a cheat's gains out of the game, logged with the reason |
| `/eco stats` | the money supply and where it sits, what the server made and destroyed today, how evenly money is spread |
| `/ah` | the auction house: a chest menu of listings by category, cheapest a unit first; click one to buy it or bid; your listings (click to take one back) and your mail |
| `/ah sell <price> [count]` | lists the stack in your hand (or part of it), whole (enchantments, name, contents...), at a fixed price, for `listing_hours` (48); listing is free |
| `/ah auction <start> [hours]` | auctions the stack in your hand from a starting bid, for 1 to 24 hours (12) |
| `/ah bid <listing> <amount>`, `/ah buy <listing>` | bids (the money is held until someone bids more or it ends), buys a fixed-price listing |
| `/ah cancel <listing>`, `/ah claim`, `/ah search <words>`, `/ah mine`, `/ah mail` | takes back a listing nobody bid on; gives you your mail; the menu on a search, your listings, your mail |
| `/shop` | the market as a chest menu: categories, a click buys one, a shift-click 64, a click on a stack of yours sells it, "Sell all" |
| `/market [item]` | the moving market as a chest menu: categories, each item's price, its move over 1 h and 24 h and its volume; an item's page buys or sells 1, 16 or 64, sells all you carry, and gives its price chart as a map |
| `/worth [item]` | an item's price, the same to buy and to sell (the one in your hand without a name) |
| `/sell hand [count]`, `/sell <item> [count]`, `/sell all` | sells to the market: the stack in your hand, an item, or everything it buys |
| `/buy <item> [count]` | buys from the market, only what fits in your inventory |
| `/trade <player>` | asks a player to trade (60 s to answer) |
| `/trade accept [player]`, `/trade deny [player]` | answers a request |
| `/trade money <amount>` | the money you add to your offer (0: none) |
| `/trade cancel` | ends your trade, or withdraws your request |
| `/coinflip <amount> [player]` | stakes an amount for anyone (or one player) to match; off unless `gambling.enabled` |
| `/lottery`, `/lottery buy <tickets>` | the pot, your tickets and the time to the draw; buys tickets (off unless `gambling.enabled`) |
| `/casino`, `/casino roulette\|slots\|crash\|blackjack` | the casino's lobby menu, or a game's table (needs `gambling.enabled` and `casino.enabled`) |
| `/casino help`, `/casino top`, `/casino stats` | every game's odds and house edge and the limits; today's biggest wins; what you bet, won and may still lose today |
| `/coinflip accept <player>`, `/coinflip cancel`, `/coinflip list` | takes an offer (a fair coin decides, the winner gets both stakes), withdraws yours, lists those waiting |
| `/spawn` | to a safe spot within `places.spawn_radius` of the server's spawn; `/setspawn` (operators of level 3) sets it where you stand |
| `/home [name]`, `/sethome [name]`, `/delhome [name]`, `/homes` | your homes (`home` when unnamed): go, set or move one where you stand, delete, list |
| `/warp <name>`, `/warps` | to a warp, the list; `/setwarp <name>`, `/delwarp <name>` for operators of level 3 |
| `/tpa <player>`, `/tpaccept [player]`, `/tpdeny [player]` | asks to go to a player (60 s to answer); answers a request |
| `/rtp`, `/wild` | to a random safe spot 500 to 10,000 blocks from the spawn, in the Overworld only; once every 5 minutes |
| `/rules` | the server's rules |
| `/back` | back to where you died, or where your last teleport took you from (warmup and cooldown as any teleport) |
| `/afk` | marks you away from the keyboard until you move, turn or run a command |
| `/playtime [player]` | how long you (or a player who is on) have played here |
| `/claim`, `/claim info`, `/unclaim` | claims the chunk you stand in (all its height), says whose it is, frees it (operators of level 3: anyone's) |
| `/claim show` | draws the border of the chunk you stand in for 10 s, for you only: green yours or a trusting owner's, red someone else's, white free |
| `/claims` | your chunks, how many you may hold, and who you trust |
| `/pingsound`, `/pingsound on`, `/pingsound off` | whether you hear a ding when someone names you in chat or `/msg`s you; turns it on or off |
| `/trust <player>`, `/untrust <player>` | lets a player (or no longer) build and use things on all your land |
| `/nick <name>`, `/nick off`, `/nick` | operators of level 3 (with `ops_only`, the default): another name for you in chat and the Tab list, shown as `~name` (hovering it gives your real one); `/nick off` (anyone with a nickname) takes it off; `/nick` alone says how |
| `/nick <player> <name\|off>` | operators of level 3: sets or takes off a player's nickname |
| `/realname <nick>` | who goes by that nickname |
| `/vanish`, `/vanish list` | operators of level 3: hides you from the other players, or shows you again; who is vanished |
| `/invsee <player>`, `/endersee <player>` | operators of level 3: the player's inventory (main, hotbar, armour, off hand) or ender chest in a chest menu, on or off the server; click one of theirs to take it, one of yours to give it; every move in `audit.log`, a summary in `staff.log` |
| `/sidebar off`, `/sidebar on`, `/sidebar` | hides the scoreboard sidebar for you (remembered), shows it again |
| `/smp status`, `/smp off [part\|all] [reason]`, `/smp on [part\|all]` | operators of level 3: the emergency switches (below) |
| `/report <player> <reason>` | anyone: tells the staff about a player (a reason is needed; one report every `reports.cooldown_seconds`, 120). Operators of level 3 on read it at once; one who joins later is told how many came in the last 24 hours. Kept in `reports.log` and the server's log |
| `/reports [page]` | operators of level 3: the reports, newest first (the last 100 kept in memory, read back from `reports.log` at the start) |
| `/ledger [page]`, `/ledger <player> [page]`, `/ledger minted` | operators of level 3: the coin ledger (`audit.log`): the newest coin movements (who to whom, how much, why, when), one player's, or the coins the server made and destroyed in each of the last 6 hours and what made most of them. Reads the end of the file (1 MB) only when asked |

The market trades only plain items (not worn, named or enchanted), and only with players in survival or adventure
mode. Items move first, then money, both logged; a sale the log refuses gives the items back, and a purchase checks the
money and the room before anything moves.

**No way to get rich from the market.** The market makes money only from what players gather:
- One price per item, to buy and to sell (since 0.29): a config that still has two (`buy` 400, `sell` 100) gets
  their geometric mean (200) at load, logged ("one price now"); `buy` or `sell` 0 still closes that side. A trade
  of N items is priced along the curve it moves the price on (below), so buying N and selling them back gives back
  exactly what was paid (less whole-coin rounding): a round trip never earns (tested for 1, 64 and past the minute's band, and
  over thousands of random trades with the drift in between).
- No chain of recipes turns what the market sells into something it buys for more: the cheapest way to get each item
  from the market (bought, or crafted, smelted, cut from bought items, through any number of recipes) is worked out,
  and an item the market would buy for more than that isn't bought. The tests walk every vanilla recipe
  (`SMP_VANILLA_DATA=<.local/horizon-client/26.3/data/minecraft> cargo test`); the server checks the iron, gold,
  copper, diamond, emerald, coal, redstone, lapis, wheat, wood and food chains at each start.
- Items a recipe links (an ingot and its block, wheat and hay...) share one moving price, the block moving it as
  its 9 ingots do, so crafting never beats the market however prices move; the vanilla-recipe test checks every item
  at the worst drift (what makes it at 0.2 times its price, it at 1.6) too.
- There are no daily coin or per-item limits on market sales, or daily limits on `/pay` receipts.
  The former `daily_sell_coins` and `daily_sell_items` settings and `market.json` counts are ignored,
  including in existing server files.
- Amounts are checked: no price above 1,000,000,000,000, no sum that overflows.
- The coinflip and the lottery give the winner all the stakes: they move money between players and never make any.

Default prices (coins; "buy only": the market sells it but doesn't buy it, "sell only" the other way):

| Category | Items |
|---|---|
| Farming | wheat 2, carrot 2, potato 2, beetroot 2, sugar cane 2, pumpkin 5, melon slice 1, cactus 2; buy only: wheat seeds 2, bone meal 3 |
| Mining | coal 4, copper ingot 3, iron ingot 15, gold ingot 20, redstone 2, lapis 4, quartz 4, emerald 40, diamond 200 |
| Wood | the eight logs 2 |
| Mob drops | bone 2, string 2, gunpowder 4, spider eye 2, slime ball 4, blaze rod 15, leather 3, feather 1; sell only: rotten flesh 1 |
| Building (buy only) | cobblestone 1, stone 2, dirt 1, sand 2, gravel 2, glass 3, bricks 4, stone bricks 3 |
| Food (buy only) | bread 5, cooked beef 6, cooked porkchop 6, cooked chicken 5, baked potato 4, apple 4, golden carrot 40 |
| Tools (buy only) | torch 1, ladder 2, crafting table 4, chest 6, furnace 6 |

A `config.json` still holding the 18 prices of versions 0.1 to 0.11, never edited, gets these at the first start of
0.12.0; edited prices are kept. Only items that stack to 64 belong in the market: a shift-click buys 64, and what
doesn't fit falls at the player's feet for them.

**/invsee and /endersee.** For operators of level 3 (luzW, bunchy7s...). The menu shows the main inventory in its
first three rows, the hotbar in the fourth, then the armour (head to feet) and the off hand; the ender chest fills
three rows. A click on one of the player's stacks moves it whole into the operator's inventory; a click on one of the
operator's own moves it into the player's (main inventory or ender chest, where it fits whole). A stack moves only if
it is still exactly what the menu showed: the game checks it and moves it, or nothing (no copy, no loss). A player who
isn't on is read from and written to their saved file; while they log in or are dead nothing moves and the menu says
why. The menu is read again once a second while open; nothing runs when none is open. Each move is in `audit.log`
before it is made (`invsee_take`, `invsee_put`: operator, player, inventory, item, count; a refused one again with
its reason); closing the menu writes one line to the server log (`[smp] staff: ...`), `staff.log`, and the chat of
the other operators on. Needs horizon#6106 (`native_inventory`, `native_move_stack`).

**Vanish.** `/vanish` takes an operator of level 3 out of the Tab list and the world of every player below level 3,
whatever the game mode (survival and creative too), and those players don't read them joining or leaving; operators of
level 3 or more still see them, and are told who vanished. A vanished operator reads a line above the hotbar the
whole time (*Vanished: only operators see you*), isn't counted online (the sidebar, the Tab list's footer), doesn't hold the night up, isn't
announced as AFK or on a first join, and can't be reached by name by those who don't see them (`/tpa`, `/trade`,
`/coinflip`, `/playtime`). It lasts over a relog and a restart (`vanish.json`) until `/vanish` again. Needs
horizon#7003 (`native_hide_player`).

**Nicknames.** With `ops_only` (the default since 0.22) only operators of level 3 set nicknames: their own, or a
player's with `/nick <player> <name>`; a player may take off the one given to them (`/nick off`). At each start, a
nickname a player who isn't an operator picked themselves is taken off and logged (`for operators only`). 3 to 16 letters, digits or `_`, shown with a `~` in front (`~Rocky`) so a nickname never passes for
a real name. Names are compared case-insensitively with `_` dropped and look-alikes folded (`0`→o, `1`/`i`→l, `3`→e,
`4`→a, `5`→s, `7`→t, `8`→b, `9`→g). Refused: a nickname equal to, or containing (from 4 letters), the name of anyone
who has played here (the economy's accounts and `usercache.json`), an operator (`ops.json`), the Team (`protected`)
or another player's nickname; one that reads as a reserved word (`reserved`: server, console, admin, mod, owner,
staff, op, horizon, kira, notch, mojang, herobrine...); one the server's chat filter refuses. A player needs
`min_playtime_minutes` of play before their first nickname (operators don't). At each start, nicknames that break
these rules are taken off, each logged (`[smp] nickname X of <uuid> taken off: why`). The change is made at the next
second. The nickname shows in chat (messages, `/me`, `/msg`) and the Tab list, and hovering it gives the real name;
the real name stays everywhere else: the server's log, the anticheat, selectors, the Discord bridge. `/pay`, `/tpa`,
`/trade`, `/playtime`, `/tpaccept`, `/tpdeny` and `/eco` take a nickname (with or without `~`) wherever they take a
player's name. The player's profile (name, UUID) never changes.
`config.json`'s `nicks`: `enabled`, `ops_only` (true), `cooldown_seconds` (600), `min_playtime_minutes` (60), `protected` (the Team's
names), `reserved` (the words above).

**Moving prices** (`market.dynamic`, on by default since 0.26). Each item has one price: its base price (`items`)
times a factor that supply and demand move as each trade happens. Every item bought raises the log of the factor by
`1% / depth`, every item sold lowers it as much, where the depth follows the item's rarity (400 / its price, between
2 and 50: a diamond moves 25 times faster per item than cobblestone, and any item reaches the floor within 10,000
sold; `depth` overrides it per item). A trade of N is
worth the area under that curve (`price / step × (e^(N × step) - 1)`), rounded up to whole coins when buying and down
when selling: one diamond at 200 costs 201 and sells for 199, 64 cobblestone at 1 cost 65, and a sale walks back the
exact path of the purchase. All trades together move an item at most `max_minute_move_percent` (5%) a minute from
where it started that minute: past that, a purchase is cut short and a sale keeps the rest ("sell them in a
minute"). The factor goes back to 1 with a half-life of `half_life_hours` (6) and stays within `min_factor` (0.2)
and `max_factor` (1.6), where the rest of a trade goes at that price. With no daily sale caps (since 0.33), the floor
is what bounds a farm: selling one item without end takes its price down to a fifth of its base, where it stays while
the selling goes on; a config with the old floor (0.6) gets 0.2 when it loads. There is no tax on trades (an older config's
`tax_percent` is ignored): the receipt is the price ("Sold 3 diamond at 198 coins each: 595 coins."). Market purchases can be sold back immediately;
the former `round_trip_hours` setting and saved purchase receipts are ignored. (`max_trade_impact_percent` and
`max_player_impact_percent` are no longer used: the curve and the
minute's band do their work.) History: one point a minute for 24 hours and one an hour for 30 days (the mid price, the
items traded and those sold), in `market_prices.json`, written by a thread every 5 minutes and when the world closes.
At the first minute of each UTC day, the day's three biggest risers and fallers (at least 1%) and news from real
activity ("Diamond supply up 40% today", sales against the day before's, at least `news_percent` and
`news_min_volume`) go to everyone's chat and to `web/market.json` for Kira to post. `enabled: false` keeps the
fixed prices of 0.23. For other mods: `Market::spot`, `volume(id, now, hours)`, `history(id, Span)`.

**`/market`.** A 6-row chest menu: the shop's categories and the day's movers; a category's items, each with its
price, its change over 1 h and 24 h (green ▲, red ▼) and what was traded in 24 h; an item's page with its
base price , buttons to buy or sell 1, 16 and 64 (what they come to
along the curve), sell all of it you carry, and the price chart over 24 hours or 7 days, given as a filled map (128 × 128,
drawn by the server: the curve green when it rose, red when it fell, the price, the change, the low and high). A
chart map is drawn again each minute for whoever carries it, and once a minute the open menus follow the prices.
`/market <item>` opens the item's page. `/worth` adds the item's moves and volume.

**The shop.** `/shop` opens a 6-row chest menu on the market's prices: the categories of `config.json`'s `shop` (an
item in none goes under "Other"), each item named with its prices. A click buys one, a shift-click 64; a click on a
stack in your own inventory, below the menu, sells it; "Sell all" sells everything the market buys. The bottom row
shows your balance. It goes through the market's own rules (survival or adventure only,
items then money, logged); the items move by the console's `clear` and `give`, measured on the
inventory before and after, so the money follows what really moved.

**Trades.** Once accepted, both players see a 6-row chest menu: their own offer on the left (16 stacks), the other's
on the right, each side's money, their confirm and cancel buttons, and whether the other has confirmed. A click on a
stack in your inventory, below the menu, adds it to your offer; a click on it in your offer takes it back. The menu
moves nothing: offered stacks stay in their owners' inventories, the menu shows copies, and a stack that changes
(used, dropped, grown by a pickup) leaves the offer. Any change clears both confirmations. When both have confirmed,
the server checks that each still holds exactly what they offer, has room for what they get and has the money, logs
the trade, and swaps everything in one step, or nothing (and both must confirm again). Closing the menu,
`/trade cancel`, leaving, dying or the other player leaving ends the trade with nothing moved. Survival and
adventure players only.

**Coinflips.** Off by default: the owner turns them on in `config.json` (`gambling`: `enabled`, `min_bet` 10,
`max_bet` 1000, `cooldown_seconds` 30, `offer_seconds` 60). A stake is held from the offer, in
`economy.json` with the balances, until the coin falls; an offer cancelled, not taken in time, or whose player
left gives it back, and so does the next start for one the server stopped with. The coin is a fresh random key from
the system, never the world's random. Only the in-game currency is staked and won.

**The lottery.** Part of `gambling` (`ticket_price` 10, `max_tickets` 100 a player a draw, `lottery_seconds` 3600
from a round's first ticket to its draw). Tickets are held like coinflip stakes; at the draw one ticket is picked at
random among all sold (more tickets, more chances), its owner gets the whole pot, and everyone hears
it. A round with a single player, or one the server stopped with, gives every ticket back.

**The casino.** On with `gambling.enabled` (and `casino.enabled`, true by default). Every game is a chest menu any
stock client can play, animated by changing its items at most 5 times a second for each open menu (and only while a
round moves), with note-block sounds, titles and the action bar for results, fireworks and a line for everyone on a
jackpot:

- European roulette: one zero, red/black, odd/even, 1-18/19-36 pay 1 to 1, dozens and columns 2 to 1, a number 35 to
  1; house edge 2.70% on every bet. The wheel turns and slows down on the drawn pocket.
- Slots: 3 reels of 32 stops with item symbols, one payline, a published paytable (three Nether Stars 500x down to
  three Berries 6x, two Berries 2x); 94.2% paid back (house edge 5.8%), one pull in 4.5 pays.
- Crash: one shared round; bet in the 10 s before take-off, then cash out (or set an automatic cash-out) before it
  crashes. P(crash at x or more) = 96% / x, capped at 100x: 96% paid back whatever you do. Each player in the round
  sees the multiplier in their own boss bar and the action bar.
- Blackjack: 6 decks shuffled each hand, the dealer stands on all 17s and peeks, blackjack pays 3 to 2, double on the
  first two cards, no split; about 1% house edge with basic strategy.

Every draw is made by the server (ChaCha20 keyed from the system) before the animation starts. Bets go from `min_bet`
10 to `max_bet` 1000; a player may lose at most `daily_loss_cap` (10,000) a day (UTC, all games together) and win at most
`daily_win_cap` (10,000) net (once reached, no new bet until 00:00 UTC; the round that crosses it is paid in full), and
`cooldown_ms` (2000) passes between the end of a round and their next bet. A bet is held like a coinflip stake;
closing the menu or leaving never loses a round: a spin or a pull ends and is paid, a blackjack hand stands, a crash
bet is cashed out when its player leaves in flight (or given back before take-off). Wins are paid from the casino's
pot (`economy.json`'s pool `casino`): a win larger than the pot is paid up to it. A new casino's pot gets `float`
(20,000) once, made for it (`casino_float`; an older pot only what it lacks of it), then keeps every lost bet: the
house edge stays in the pot, out of the players' hands. A win of `jackpot_multiple` (50) times the stake, or of `announce_profit` (5000) coins, is
told to everyone. Settings in `config.json`'s `casino`, also `crash_edge_percent` (4) and `crash_max` (100).

**Places.** A teleport waits `warmup_seconds` (3) in `config.json`'s `places`; a player who moves or is hurt meanwhile
stays where they are, and `cooldown_seconds` (10) passes between two of one player's teleports. Teleports are free (an older config's
`places.fees` is ignored). `/tpa` takes the
asker to where the other player is when the warmup ends. Homes grow with the time played on the server since the mod
was on (`homes`: `[hours, homes]`, by default 1 home, 2 from 5 hours, 3 from 20, 5 from 100). `rules` holds `/rules`'
lines. `/spawn` lands on a random safe column within `spawn_radius` (250) blocks of the spawn point, like vanilla's `respawn_radius` for a first join or a respawn: after the `tp`, vanilla's `spreadplayers` moves the player off fluid, fire and magma onto solid ground (0: exactly the spawn point; if no column is found the player stays at the spawn point). Teleports are vanilla's `tp`, run as the server (`execute in <level> run tp`), so they cross levels and land
as any teleport does.

`/rtp` (or `/wild`) draws `rtp_attempts` (6) chunks at random between `rtp_min_distance` (500) and `rtp_max_distance`
(10000) blocks from the spawn (`/setspawn`'s point, 0 0 without one), uniform over the ring's area and at least 16 blocks
inside the world border (as last saved in `world_border.dat`), then holds them loaded one after another with vanilla's
`forceload` while the warmup runs: the game generates them on its worker threads, never on the server tick. Once a
chunk is loaded, the Overworld's tick reads its 256 columns (`native_read_columns`, the top block below the
`MOTION_BLOCKING_NO_LEAVES` height and the two above it) and the player lands, still standing still, on a random one
whose top block is solid ground (no fluid, fire, cactus, magma, powder snow, berry bush or dripstone) with air or grass
above it, outside another player's claim and still in the ring and the border; with none the next chunk is tried. With
no spot after the six, or no land loaded `rtp_search_seconds` (30) after the warmup, it says so and nothing is spent.
A teleport made starts `rtp_cooldown_seconds` (300) for that player, kept in `places.json` over restarts ("Wait 2 min
before your next /rtp."); a teleport called off (a move, a hit, the game failing it) doesn't. Elsewhere than the
Overworld it refuses. The chunks it forced are let go 10 s after the landing, or at the next start if the server
stopped first; a chunk an operator forced already is used and left forced. `/back` returns from it as from any teleport.

**Claims.** In a claimed chunk, only its owner, the players they trust and operators of level 3 break blocks or right
click blocks: doors, chests, levers, buttons, placing a block, a bucket or flint on a block. Anyone else's click does
nothing, and the action bar says whose land it is. The chunks a player may hold grow with the time played here
(`claims.chunks`: `[hours, chunks]`, by default 4, 16 from 5 hours, 36 from 20, 64 from 100); `claims.enabled`
turns them off. `claims.free_radius` (0, none) keeps the land within that many blocks of 0 0, in every dimension, free
for all: no one claims a chunk that touches it, and claims already there are dropped at start (each logged). The world stays out too: no water or lava flows, no fire spreads or burns, and no piston pushes into
a claim from land that isn't its owner's (or a player's they trust), and explosions break no claimed block, whoever
lit them (a TNT cannon, a creeper, a crystal, a bed, a wither skull), nor the claim's animals, paintings and item
frames. Buckets are guarded where they fill or empty; nothing is placed against a claim's border from outside (a
block, fire, a spawn egg, an armour stand); a dispenser does nothing to the block in front of it in another's
claim; lava outside a claim lights none of its blocks (lava 4 or more blocks inside still lights its owner's). A
projectile of someone not trusted (an arrow, a trident, a snowball, a pearl, a potion, a fire charge) does nothing in
a claim but to monsters and players: no button pressed, target lit, chorus or pot broken, TNT lit, crystal set off,
pearl landed or animal hurt; a dispenser's counts as from the land it shot from, a mob's hurts animals only. Hitting
or right clicking the claim's item frames, armour stands, paintings, boats, minecarts and animals (leads, saddles,
shears, dyes, buckets, a frame's or a stand's items) does nothing for others (`claims.protected_entities`, entity
ids; monsters and players aren't in it; villagers and wandering traders still trade; end crystals are always guarded,
even when a world's list predates them). Not guarded yet, for want of a
Horizon hook: wind charges bursting outside a claim (they open doors inside), armour stands and vehicles in a blast,
farmland trampled, a wither's or an enderman's own block changes. The server's `spawn-protection` (vanilla's) guards
the spawn.

**Chat pings.** A chat line that names an online player (a whole word, any case: `alex`, `@Alex`) plays the
experience orb pickup sound to that player alone, and so does a `/msg`, `/tell` or `/w` to them; never the sender, at
most once each 3 s per player. `/pingsound off` turns it off for oneself (`pings.json`), `/pingsound on` back.

**The scoreboard.** A sidebar on the right, titled `board.title` ("Horizon SMP"): your own block first (your name, or
your nickname; your balance, `125.4k`, `3.2M`; your playtime, `2h 05m`; the players online), then `board.footer`
(`play.playhorizon.dev`, empty for none). It lists no ranking: `/baltop` does (`board.top`, of 0.14 to 0.29, is
ignored). The balances are read once for everyone, only when one changed (at most every `board.min_seconds`, 5) or
every `board.refresh_seconds` (60); each player's own lines are looked at on the same `board.refresh_seconds`, and a
sidebar is sent only to the players whose lines changed and to newcomers: nothing runs per tick per player. The Tab
list shows `board.tab_header` and `board.tab_footer` (`{server}`, `{tps}`, `{players}` filled in, every
`board.tab_refresh_seconds`, 5). `board.sidebar` and `board.tab` turn either off; `board.server_name` names the Tab
list. A server that kept 0.13's title (`Richest players`) gets `Horizon SMP` at its first start. The
sidebar uses one scoreboard objective of its own (`horizon:native_sidebar`) and leaves the world's scoreboard alone.

**Presence.** A player's first join is announced to everyone (`presence.first_join`, empty for none) and they read
`presence.welcome` and the rules. Each player gets `presence.daily_reward` (50) once a day (UTC) after
`presence.reward_after_minutes` (10) of play that day, logged as `daily_reward` (0 turns it off). Only seconds with a
move, a turn or a command in the minute before count, so an alt that logs in and stands still gets nothing (on
2026-11-01, 1,242 players got the reward; 323 of them had played 10 minutes in all). The count isn't kept over a
restart. A player who hasn't moved, turned or run a command for `presence.afk_minutes` (5),
or typed `/afk`, is AFK: they don't count for sleeping (vanilla's `players_sleeping_percentage`) until they move or
get in a bed; `presence.afk_announce` tells everyone instead of only them. A player runs at most
`presence.spam_commands` (8) of the SMP's commands in `presence.spam_seconds` (5); operators of level 3 aren't
limited. All of it is looked at once a second.

**The auction house.** Players sell to players: a listing is a fixed price or a timed auction. The listed items
leave the seller's inventory at once; what doesn't sell, what an auction's winner gets, and what didn't fit in a
buyer's inventory wait in the player's mail (`/ah claim`, or the menu's mail page; as much as fits, the rest stays).
A purchase takes the whole listing: the listing leaves first, the items move, then the money (the seller gets the
whole price); of two players who buy at once (the game runs every click on one
thread), the second finds it gone. Bids wait in the `auction` pool: a higher bid gives the last one back at once,
raising one's own only holds the difference, and a bid in the last `snipe_seconds` (60) moves the end back to
60 seconds away. When an auction ends, the seller is paid the winning bid and the items go to the winner's mail. Sellers
and outbid players who are offline find a note when they come back. Everything (listings, bids, mail, notes) is
written in `economy.json` with the balances, in one step: a crash can't keep the money and lose the items, or the
reverse. A listing carries the whole stack (since 0.31): its enchantments, name, damage, lore, a shulker box's
or a bundle's contents and every other component, written as the game writes it in player files, and given back
exactly so (Horizon's `native_give_stack`) to the buyer, the winner, or the seller when it comes back. `/ah sell
<price> <count>` lists part of the stack in hand; the rest stays in the hand, the same. The menu shows the stack
itself (its tooltip), with the listing's price, seller and time under it. A stack is taken only if it would come
back the same (its data written and read back equal); not market charts (free at `/market`), nor a stack holding
more than 32 KiB of data (a box of books). Listings and mail from before 0.31 hold plain items and are given back as
before. Survival and adventure players only. `config.json`'s `auction`:
`enabled`, `max_listings` (8 a player), `listing_hours` (48), `auction_hours` (12),
`auction_hours_max` (24), `bid_step_percent` (5: the smallest raise), `snipe_seconds` (60). Ended listings are
looked at once a second (a pass over the open listings).

**Money in and out.** Money enters the game through what the market buys from players, the daily reward, the
casino's float (once) and operators' `/eco give` (with a reason everyone reads, logged as `eco_give`). It leaves
through what the market sells and operators' `/eco take`. There are no fees, taxes, bank, contracts or futures: no
VAT, land or wealth tax, no tax on market trades, no teleport, auction or coinflip fee. A world from before 0.30 is
cleaned up at its first start: bank savings and the margins of open futures positions go back to their owners
(`bank_closed`, `futures_closed`), and the Treasury, its insurance fund, contracts and land tax owed are dropped.
`config.json`'s old `taxes`, `bank`, `jobs` and `futures` sections and the `fee_percent` and `listing_fee_percent`
keys are ignored.

**The report.** `/eco stats` (anyone) shows the money supply (wallets and money held, each pool, the casino's pot),
what the server made today (market sales, the daily reward, `/eco give`) and destroyed (market purchases, operators'
`/eco take`), and how evenly money is spread (Gini over players
with money, the richest ten's share). At 00:00 UTC everyone reads the day before in one line (`report.daily_report`).
A snapshot of each day is kept 60 days (`report.history_days`) in `economy.json` (`ext.report`). Once a minute
`world/horizon-smp/web/economy.json` (`report.web_json`) is written off the tick thread for the site's /hub:
`{"schema": 1, "generated": <ms>, "currency", "today", "pools", "minted_today", "burned_today", "days": [...],
"daily_report": "<yesterday's line>"}`. The server's Discord relay posts only chat, joins, leaves and deaths: the
daily line reaches Discord through whoever reads that file (Kira).

Other parts reach the pools through `Economy::to_pool`, `from_pool`, `pool_move` and `settle_pool` (a bet against a
pool: the stake goes in, the payout comes out, never more than the pool holds), each one audit line.

The currency is earned in game only: it can't be bought with real money or cashed out (Mojang's usage guidelines).

**Emergency switches.** An operator of level 3 turns parts of the SMP off while the server runs: `/smp off`
(everything but land protection), `/smp off <part> [reason]`, `/smp on [part]`, `/smp status` (what is off, by whom,
when and why). Parts: `economy` (balances, `/pay`, `/eco`, the daily
reward), `market` (`/worth`, `/sell`, `/buy`, `/shop`, `/market`), `auction`, `trades`, `gambling` (coinflips, the
lottery, the casino), `places` (spawn, homes, warps, `/tpa`, `/back`), `claims` (land protection and
`/claim`: only by name, `/smp off claims`), `board` (the sidebar and the Tab list's header and footer), `presence`
(welcomes, AFK, the commands' rate limit), `nicks`, `invsee`. A part that is off answers its commands with "... is
turned off for now by the server's staff", and its menus close at the next click. Turning one off ends open trades
with nothing moved, closes the shop, market and auction menus, calls off teleports waiting, takes the
sidebars and nicknames away. Its timed work waits (the lottery's draw, auctions ending, the daily reward); nothing held is lost: coinflips not taken still go back and a casino
round under way still ends and is paid. The other operators on are told, and each change is in the server's log and
`audit.log` (`switch_off`, `switch_on`). What is off is kept in `switches.json`, so a restart keeps it off.

## Data

Everything is in the world's folder, `world/horizon-smp/`, so a backup of the world carries it. A world without that
folder is untouched until the mod first runs on it; it changes no block and no player.

| File | Holds |
|---|---|
| `config.json` | `currency` (default `coins`), `starting_balance` (default 0), `market`: `enabled`, `items` (each item's `buy`, what the market asks, and `sell`, what it pays, 0 closing that side), `shop`: `enabled`, `title`, `categories` (`name`, `icon`, `items`); `web`: `url` (Kira's `/smp/ingest`) and `token` (empty: nothing is sent), where the pages of `web/` go; written with the defaults the first time, and again when a newer version adds keys (your values kept) |
| `economy.json` | balances by player UUID, with the name last seen; `held`: coinflip stakes and lottery tickets being decided; `pools`: the casino's pot and the auction house's bids; `ext`: other parts' state written in the same step as the money (`auction`: the listings, bids, mail and notes) |
| `places.json` | the spawn, the warps, each player's homes, and the seconds each player has played (written once a minute) |
| `nicks.json` | each player's nickname and when they last changed it |
| `vanish.json` | the vanished operators by UUID, with their name |
| `reports.log` | one JSON line per `/report`: `time`, `by`/`by_name`, `player`/`player_name`, `reason`, where each stood (`by_at`, `player_at` when on) |
| `staff.log` | one line per `/invsee` or `/endersee` menu in which something moved: who, whose, what was taken and put |
| `market_prices.json` | each item's price factor and history (minutes for 24 h, hours for 30 days: `[time, mid, traded, sold]`), the day's summary |
| `web/market.json` | for the website (`/hub/market`, through Kira), written by a thread each minute prices move: `schema` 1, `generated`, `currency`, `tax_percent` (always 0, for older readers), `daily_summary` (`day`, `lines`), `items` (`id`, `name`, `category`, `price` (the one price; `buy` and `sell` repeat it on the sides the market trades, for older readers), `mid`, `base`, `change_1h`, `change_24h`, `volume_24h`, `day`: 5-minute points, `month`: hours, each `{step, t, price, volume}`). When `web.token` is set, the same thread POSTs each page of `web/` that changed (gzipped, `Authorization: Bearer <token>`) to `<web.url>/<name>`: Kira keeps the last one and serves it to the site; the server needs no inbound access and Kira no key to it |
| `presence.json` | the players who have joined (no welcome again), and the day each last got the daily reward |
| `board.json` | the players who hid the sidebar (`/sidebar off`) |
| `switches.json` | the parts operators turned off (`/smp off`): by whom, when and why |
| `casino.json` | the day's ledger: each player's bets, wins and rounds today (the daily loss cap), the day's biggest wins, each game's totals, the pot's last sweep |
| `pings.json` | the players who turned chat pings off (`/pingsound off`) |
| `claims.json` | each claimed chunk (`<dimension> <chunk x> <chunk z>`) with its owner, and whom each owner trusts |
| `audit.log` | one JSON line per change, written before the change: `time` (ms), `kind` (`open`, `pay`, `grant`, `ah_listing_fee`...), `amount`, `from`/`to` with their balance before, `by` for an operator, `to_pool`/`from_pool` with `pool_before` and `reason` for a pool's movement, `flow` (`minted` or `burned`) for money the server made or destroyed (a market sale or purchase, the daily reward, `/eco give` and `take`); a trade's line (`trade`: both players, their items and money) comes before its swap, `trade_failed` after one that didn't go through |

`economy.json` is written whole to a temporary file, flushed and renamed over the old one, at most once a server tick
and when the world closes: a crash leaves the old file or the new one. If it can't be read, the economy stays off (the
commands say so) rather than start from nothing.

## Made on the hook points

It hooks only Horizon's native hook points: `native_register_commands` and `native_perform_command` (API 8), the
acting player's items (API 9), the server menus and `native_exchange_items` (API 10), the players' health and
`native_run_command` (API 21), `native_destroy_block` (API 14), `native_right_click_block`, the acting player and the
action bar (API 21), `native_block_spread`, `native_piston_move`, `native_explosion_detonate`, `native_fill_bucket` and
`native_attack_entity` (API 22), `native_sidebar`, `native_tab_list` and `native_tick_stats` (API 49),
`native_set_nickname` and `native_text_allowed` (API 62), `native_hide_player` (API 314, horizon#7003), the server tick and the world lifecycle.
`compatibility.json` names `"hooks": 58`.

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `mixins/smp/horizon-mixin.toml` | The bundle: twenty-nine modules and the HEAD hooks |
| `mixins/smp/smp_store.rs`, `smp_economy.rs`, `smp_market.rs`, `smp_recipes.rs`, `smp_shop.rs`, `smp_nick.rs`, `smp_trade.rs`, `smp_games.rs`, `smp_lottery.rs`, `smp_places.rs`, `smp_claims.rs`, `smp_board.rs`, `smp_presence.rs`, `smp_auction.rs`, `smp_report.rs`, `smp_market_prices.rs`, `smp_market_menu.rs`, `smp_market_chart.rs`, `smp_invsee.rs`, `smp_switch.rs`, `smp_vanish.rs` | The rules, no game types (a trade's stacks are a type parameter): added to the game as `game::smp_store`, `game::smp_economy`, `game::smp_market`, `game::smp_recipes`, `game::smp_shop`, `game::smp_nick`, `game::smp_trade`, `game::smp_games`, `game::smp_lottery`, `game::smp_places`, `game::smp_claims`, `game::smp_board`, `game::smp_presence`, `game::smp_auction`, `game::smp_report`, `game::smp_market_prices`, `game::smp_market_menu`, `game::smp_market_chart`, `game::smp_invsee`, `game::smp_switch`, `game::smp_vanish`; also this crate's modules (`src/lib.rs`), for their tests |
| `mixins/smp/glue.rs` | The state for the open world and the edges to the game's types (`game::smp_glue`) |
| `mixins/smp/{register,command,tick,lifecycle,menu_clicked,menu_closed,destroy_block,right_click_block,block_spread,piston_move,explosion_detonate,fill_bucket,attack_entity}.rs` | One small helper per hook |
| `mixins/smp/smp_casino.rs`, `smp_casino_roulette.rs`, `smp_casino_slots.rs`, `smp_casino_crash.rs`, `smp_casino_blackjack.rs` | The casino's rules, menus and effects (`game::smp_casino*`) |
| `mixins/smp/casino_glue.rs` | The casino's effects for a stock client: menu items, sounds, titles, fireworks, boss bars (`game::smp_casino_glue`) |
| `proof.py` | A dedicated server built with the mod and two real clients, on fresh temporary data |
| `proof_casino.py` | The casino's proof (`SMP_PROOF=casino`): both clients play every game through the menus |

## Build and prove

```sh
(cd native/smp && cargo test)                          # the rules
python3 native/tools/native.py check smp               # apply on the tested Horizon and cargo check the game
python3 native/tools/native.py proof smp --resources /path/to/.local/horizon-client/26.3
```

## The official server's engine

The server runs `horizon-server` as usual, with `[engine] path` pointing at a game built with this mod:

```sh
NATIVE_NO_DEFAULT_FEATURES=1 python3 native/tools/native.py build smp --horizon <the release's commit>
```

prints the built `horizon-client` (`--no-default-features`: the server build, without audio and controllers). When
to deploy it on the official server is the owners' decision.
