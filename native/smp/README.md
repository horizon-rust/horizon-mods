# SMP (Horizon native server mod)

The official Horizon server's survival layer ([design](https://github.com/horizon-rust/horizon/blob/main/docs/smp.md)).
It is **not** part of Horizon's own server: only a server that builds this mod into its engine has it. It isn't listed
in the registry.

Players install nothing: it speaks only what a stock Horizon client already shows (commands with completions, chat
lines, vanilla chest menus the server fills with ordinary items (the trade menu); later sounds, titles, the action
bar, boss bars and the sidebar).

This version: the economy, the server market and player trades.

| Command | Does |
|---|---|
| `/balance [player]`, `/bal` | your balance, or another player's |
| `/pay <player> <amount>` | gives money to a player who has an account (anyone who has played since the mod was on) |
| `/baltop [page]` | the richest players, 10 a page |
| `/eco give\|take\|set <player> <amount>` | operators of level 3: corrections, logged |
| `/worth [item]` | what the market pays and asks for an item (the one in your hand without a name) |
| `/sell hand [count]`, `/sell <item> [count]`, `/sell all` | sells to the market: the stack in your hand, an item, or everything it buys |
| `/buy <item> [count]` | buys from the market, only what fits in your inventory |
| `/trade <player>` | asks a player to trade (60 s to answer) |
| `/trade accept [player]`, `/trade deny [player]` | answers a request |
| `/trade money <amount>` | the money you add to your offer (0: none) |
| `/trade cancel` | ends your trade, or withdraws your request |

The market trades only plain items (not worn, named or enchanted), and only with players in survival or adventure
mode. Items move first, then money, both logged; a sale the log refuses gives the items back, and a purchase checks the
money and the room before anything moves.

**Trades.** Once accepted, both players see a 6-row chest menu: their own offer on the left (16 stacks), the other's
on the right, each side's money, their confirm and cancel buttons, and whether the other has confirmed. A click on a
stack in your inventory, below the menu, adds it to your offer; a click on it in your offer takes it back. The menu
moves nothing: offered stacks stay in their owners' inventories, the menu shows copies, and a stack that changes
(used, dropped, grown by a pickup) leaves the offer. Any change clears both confirmations. When both have confirmed,
the server checks that each still holds exactly what they offer, has room for what they get and has the money, logs
the trade, and swaps everything in one step, or nothing (and both must confirm again). Closing the menu,
`/trade cancel`, leaving, dying or the other player leaving ends the trade with nothing moved. Survival and
adventure players only.

The currency is earned in game only: it can't be bought with real money or cashed out (Mojang's usage guidelines).

## Data

Everything is in the world's folder, `world/horizon-smp/`, so a backup of the world carries it. A world without that
folder is untouched until the mod first runs on it; it changes no block and no player.

| File | Holds |
|---|---|
| `config.json` | `currency` (default `coins`), `starting_balance` (default 0), and `market`: `enabled` and `items`, each item's `buy` (what the market asks) and `sell` (what it pays), 0 closing that side; written with the defaults the first time, and again when a newer version adds keys (your values kept) |
| `economy.json` | balances by player UUID, with the name last seen |
| `audit.log` | one JSON line per change, written before the change: `time` (ms), `kind` (`open`, `pay`, `eco_give`...), `amount`, `from`/`to` with their balance before, `by` for an operator; a trade's line (`trade`: both players, their items and money) comes before its swap, `trade_failed` after one that didn't go through |

`economy.json` is written whole to a temporary file, flushed and renamed over the old one, at most once a server tick
and when the world closes: a crash leaves the old file or the new one. If it can't be read, the economy stays off (the
commands say so) rather than start from nothing.

## Made on the hook points

It hooks only Horizon's native hook points: `native_register_commands` and `native_perform_command` (API 8), the
acting player's items (API 9), the server menus and `native_exchange_items` (API 10), the server tick and the world
lifecycle. `compatibility.json` names `"hooks": 10`.

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `mixins/smp/horizon-mixin.toml` | The bundle: five modules and the HEAD hooks |
| `mixins/smp/smp_store.rs`, `smp_economy.rs`, `smp_market.rs`, `smp_trade.rs` | The rules, no game types (a trade's stacks are a type parameter): added to the game as `game::smp_store`, `game::smp_economy`, `game::smp_market`, `game::smp_trade`; also this crate's modules (`src/lib.rs`), for their tests |
| `mixins/smp/glue.rs` | The state for the open world and the edges to the game's types (`game::smp_glue`) |
| `mixins/smp/{register,command,tick,lifecycle,menu_clicked,menu_closed}.rs` | One small helper per hook |
| `proof.py` | A dedicated server built with the mod and two real clients, on fresh temporary data |

## Build and prove

```sh
(cd native/smp && cargo test)                          # the rules
python3 native/tools/native.py check smp               # apply on the tested Horizon and cargo check the game
python3 native/tools/native.py proof smp --resources /path/to/.local/horizon-client/26.3
```

## The official server's engine

The server runs `horizon-server` as usual, with `[engine] path` pointing at a game built with this mod:

```sh
NATIVE_NO_DEFAULT_FEATURES=1 python3 native/tools/native.py build smp --horizon <the release's commit>
```

prints the built `horizon-client` (`--no-default-features`: the server build, without audio and controllers). When
to deploy it on the official server is the owners' decision.
