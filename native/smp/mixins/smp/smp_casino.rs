// The casino (`/casino`): games against the house played in chest menus that
// animate (a roulette wheel that turns and slows down, slot reels that
// scroll), with sounds, titles and fireworks, all for an unmodded client.
// This file holds what every game shares: the settings, the server's random
// (ChaCha20 seeded from the system, never the world's or anything a client
// can see), the bets (held in `economy.json` from the moment they are placed,
// so a crash gives them back), the limits (a bet's floor and ceiling, a daily
// loss cap per player, a cooldown), the day's ledger (`casino.json`: what
// each player staked and got back today, the day's biggest wins, each game's
// totals) and the lobby menu. Winnings are paid from the casino's own pot
// (the economy's "casino" pool, which every lost bet fills); a win the pot
// can't cover is paid up to what it holds, never with new money. Once an
// hour the pot above its float goes to the Treasury: the house edge is the
// state's income, a money sink for the players. Each game is a file of its
// own (smp_casino_roulette, ...). No game types: the glue (casino_glue.rs)
// turns the icons and effects into menus, packets and commands. Added to the
// game as `game::smp_casino`; also a module of this crate, for its tests.
