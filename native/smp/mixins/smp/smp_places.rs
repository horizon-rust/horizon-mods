// Places: the server's spawn (`/spawn`, `/setspawn`), each player's homes
// (`/home`, `/sethome`, `/delhome`, `/homes`), warps (`/warp`, `/warps`,
// `/setwarp`, `/delwarp`), teleport requests between players (`/tpa`,
// `/tpaccept`, `/tpdeny`), `/rtp` (`/wild`: a random safe spot far from the
// spawn), `/back` (where the player died, or was before their last
// teleport), `/playtime` and `/rules`. A teleport waits `warmup_seconds`,
// and a player who moves or is hurt meanwhile stays where they are; the glue
// moves them with a vanilla `tp` run as the server. The number of homes grows
// with the time a player has played here, counted by the mod. Everything is
// in `places.json`, written atomically. No game types. Added to the game as
// `game::smp_places`; also a module of this crate, for its tests.
