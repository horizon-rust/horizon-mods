"""The SMP on a real dedicated server: the built game runs `--dedicated` with the mod, and two real clients (Alex and
Steve, `horizon-ctl --offscreen`) join it. Checked from the clients' own chat and from the files the server wrote:

- the economy opens an account for each player (config.json written with its defaults, then economy.json);
- /balance, /pay (the payer's answer and the payee's line), refused payments (too much, past what the payee may receive today, to oneself, unknown name);
- the Treasury: an operator (made one from the server's console) pays a player from it with a reason (/treasury pay),
  which everyone sees in /treasury and /treasury log; /eco give is refused to everyone (nobody can make money), and a
  non-operator can't pay from the Treasury; /eco taxes explains the tax code;
- /baltop;
- the commands are in each player's command tree (the chat box's suggestions);
- the market (Steve in survival, items given from the console): /worth, /sell <item>, /sell hand, /buy, with the
  items gone from or in his inventory as his client sees it; a creative player can't sell;
- trades (`/trade`, the server's chest menu clicked from each client): closing the menu, a full inventory, the
  cancel button, dying and leaving each end or refuse a trade with nothing moved (each player's items counted from
  their own client); a change of offer clears the other's confirmation; a confirmed trade swaps the items and money;
- coinflips (turned on in config.json before the first start, the other settings filled in): the stake is held from
  the offer, the winner gets both, the limits and the cooldown refuse, and a stake left waiting when the server stops
  comes back; the money in the game stays the same throughout;
- the lottery: two players' tickets held, one drawn after `lottery_seconds`, the winner announced to everyone and paid
  the pot;
- after the server stops cleanly and starts again, the balances are the same, and audit.log holds every change;
- a Treasury payment for an operator, then the /shop menu: a category, one item bought by a click and a stack by
  a shift-click, a stack of the player's own sold by clicking it, "Sell all" stopped by the daily limit (the rest
  kept, the limit shown in the menu and in /worth, the day's sales in market.json), the close button;
- after the restart, prices moving: a purchase and a sale taxed (receipts, the Treasury), an item bought can't be sold
  back while one found can, the minute timer moving diamond down after a sale and up after a purchase, /market's item
  page buying, the 24 h chart given as a map and drawn in the player's hand (market-chart.png), web/market.json, and
  market_prices.json written when the world closes;
- the web pages (web/market.json, web/economy.json) sent gzipped with the token to a stand-in for Kira;
- /invsee: an operator takes a stack from an offline player's saved inventory, logged before the move and summed up in
  staff.log;
- nicknames, for operators only: a player can't pick one; an operator's refused ones (a player's name, too short, a
  bad character), the one given in the other's chat and Tab list, /realname, someone else's taken, the player taking
  it off.

The casino has its own proof (proof_casino.py): `SMP_PROOF=casino` runs it instead of this one.

Everything runs in fresh temporary folders (the server's, each client's home, launcher and XDG folders), no audio.
