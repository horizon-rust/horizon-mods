//! xaeros-world-map runtime (behavioral port of xaero96/Xaero's World Map,

//!
//! Ported 1:1 against the behavior the mod's page documents: the self-writing
//! fullscreen map (M to open, mouse pan, wheel zoom), multiple maps per server
//! address with manual or automatic switching, cave-dimension layers, the
//! vanilla-maps mode and terrain shading flags, and "footsteps" showing the
//! most recent path taken. The waypoint overlay rides the xaeros-minimap
//! port's waypoint store; rendering and world reads ride Horizon (seams in the
//! README).
